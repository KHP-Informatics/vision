1, Now I__ thinking he maybe was worried he might hurt me like he hurt his cat? My friends &amp; fam all tell me how good it is that I got out &amp; they seem pretty sure that this would__e escalated to violence towards me
1, But he__ never thrown anything at me nor has he ever punched the wall or taken his anger out that way
1, So I called my sister and told her that I was going to the post office alone because I wanted to but my bf still didn__ want to give me the keys so I started crying to my sister

1, She has moved away from the mother
1, No matter what i've tried it's literally always sends me into panic attack and then i had to step off and try to find ways to calm myself down

1,my sister said she's calling police (I was at school) he sneakily went by blabbering some sh*t like some guy told that this house was for sale etc and went away using the vehicle he came my parents fear that he'd have some weapons 
1,"I've been getting a lot of friend requests and """"followers"""" on my personal Facebook page from random me and it was freaking me out because I don't know who these people are and if they're connected to my abuser in some way"
1,   I have a neighbor who i heard being abused
1,I have been in several abusive relationships in my life
1,    he__ been emotionally abusive for months and months but i never thought he was capable of something like this
1,My husband hasn__ hit me since the last time a week and a half or a couple of weeks ago
1, Oh and also I lied to all my friends and family who suspected him of hurting me
1,We met a girl with my friends that gets constantly bullied and domestically violated by her older sister
1, He__ interfered in every significant relationship I have to manipulate someone into thinking he__ a good guy
1, I'm so scared of the reaction when they get here and the yelling and he's gonna beg and scream for me not to go to cause a scene and throw himself down the stairs to act like he was hurt
1, The family has said things I feel were hurtful but he is mad when I say that and says I'm just too sensitive
1,   He was abusive towards me and wife #2
1,He called me from the jail where he is on charges took out on him for choking me and threatening to kill me
1, Anyway Im sorry for venting like this but would I even be eligible to go somewhere? I__ a 25 year old stuck under the thumb of my parents and it__ not a partner and I feel like everyone will just tell me to figure out how to move out and I also don__ want to take a place of someone who is being psychically abused currently bc i__ not anymore
1,I__ currently in a case fighting against my ex who manipulated me into an abortion
1,When I was with my abuser
1, It was the first time something like this has ever happened but they had been in a unstable marriage and verbally and emotionally abusive to each other and me for long time beforehand
1, I could see what I couldn't I said talking things to me like I would be a murder victim and that my children would end up Dead Or Without a mother
1, Emotionally and mentally at first but now I am scared that he is going to hit me
1," So the guy im talking about is a obese alcoholic and a drug addict he constantly breaks something and everyday he hits my mom and screams at her he once attacked my brother (that guy is 6'3 and my bro is like 5""""7) and he constantly keeps telling us how worthless we are and how our dad should die (my dad has cancer and that guy knows that this hurts us the most) and he is threating us that one day he is going to kill us"
1, I was a strong independent woman before I met him and had recently gotten out of a slightly abusive relationship
1, He then looked at me and said __hat are you going to hit me?_  He used to throw things and once broke a glass bottle when upset
1,  Becauseeee: - survivors of domestic violence get to leave their leases (but not me

1,Tonight's abuse is brought to me by dubstep
1,After 8 years of watching her get physically abused 6 of them spent in front of her young children and I__ not talking shoving
1, I told her how he has said how good it felt to hit me and how he had choked me until I clawed at his hands for my own life
1, I filed a police report about the cards opened in my mother's name and nothing ever happened
1,Idk if any of you experienced this after leaving a physically abusive relationship

1,It__ been 13 years this month since I left my abuser
1, I was hit multiple time during our year together and even more frequently she would threaten suicide if I left and she even had a short stay in the psych ward
1,The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces
1,My wife used to beat me about twice a week for about 20 years
1, My stbxh didn__ want me to do anything but fully depend on him and take his daily abuse

1," Even though my mother had a fucking certified masters degree in psychology and is actively working in united health care she still decided that she can """"fix him"""" she broke it off in 2013 I think after I got a concussion from him I was 8 years old"
